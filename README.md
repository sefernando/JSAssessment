# JSAssessment

What did you like about this project?
I like for being able to complete my first game development. Even if it's small and halfway done, completing this makes me really happy.


What did you struggle with in this project? 
I didn't realize the error once I got it when I tried to check the value of the array with negative indexes in checkHole() and foundHat() functions. I had to do a lot of console.logs and from every step to understand where the problem is. sometimes I even took my separate algorithms to Replit to check the output. 


What would make your experience with this assessment better? 
Identifying errors and fixing bugs
